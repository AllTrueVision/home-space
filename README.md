### 0. :computer: Hosting

Where is your Home Space being hosted, locally or on a server? There are advantages to both and one can use a combination of hosting methods to adhere to different needs and use-cases.


### 1. :door: Startpage

This is the 2D front-door to your virtual home, typically presented as a new tab page or also known as a [homepage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_page). It is recommended to install a custom 2D [Startpage](https://github.com/madjin/startpage) and use that as your launcher into the WebXR home space. Remember to set the new default home page in your preferred web browser of choice to this startpage so that you can easily jump back to it.

</a>

You can find many great customizable startpages here <https://startpages.github.io/> or on Github <https://github.com/search?q=startpage>.

If you're on a chrome based browser like Chrome, Chromium, or Brave, enable the Home button by going to `chrome://settings/`.

### 2. :house: Home Space 

This is the equivalent of Oculus / Steam / Windows Mixed Reality home but more customizable since its open source and using open web standards. Here's a few sample virtual home space templates:

</a>

### 3. :bridge_at_night: The Street

Choose where you place your Home Space in the metaverse. You can create a federated network of linked virtual worls with your friends, purchase virtual property on platforms like in the case of [Cryptovoxels](https://www.cryptovoxels.com) and [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org), or just host on your own local grid. The exit portal is defined on line _ in the [JML]() for the container home.

### 4. :stars: The Metaverse

In short, [the Metaverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse) is the next major iteration of the Internet, a global computer network consisting of billions of electronic devices and interconnected networks using standardized communication protocols. The current Web sits as the leading information retrieval service, giving users access to a vast array of online content by means of hypertext, hypermedia, and hyperlinks formatted in HTML and served through HTTP.

In the next decade we'll have new interfaces that see and interact in this virtual shared universe of unlimited possibility as well as new protocols to optimize the delivery of experiences.
